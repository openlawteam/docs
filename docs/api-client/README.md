# REST API and APIClient

The OpenLaw REST API is an interface in the OpenLaw protocol for querying, saving, and changing data in an OpenLaw instance. The class APIClient library in APIClient.js serves as a convenient wrapper to the REST API and can be used for many of the method calls. The API methods are categorized below.

**Parameters for REST calls**

For GET requests, any parameters not included as a segment in the path can be passed as an HTTP query string parameter.

For POST requests, any parameters not included as a segment in the path should be data of the specified Content-Type.

::: tip APIClient
In order to use the APIClient method calls, a class instance will first need to be instantiated with the root URL of an OpenLaw instance. For example:

```js
apiClient = new APIClient("https://app.openlaw.io");
```

Including just the root URL as shown above will be sufficient in most cases. But in cases where basic authentication has been enabled as further protection _in addition_ to [logging into an OpenLaw instance](#authentication), you can include the appropriate user credentials:

```js
apiClient = new APIClient({
  root: "https://openlaw-instance-with-basic-auth.openlaw.io",
  auth: {
    username: "<username>",
    password: "<password>"
  }
});
```

Each method below will include example usage of the APIClient library (with the `apiClient` instance) if available.
:::

## Authentication

Unless otherwise specified, each of the resources can be accessed by a logged in user with a `StandardUser` role, which is the default permission for a newly-registered user, or an `Admin` role, which has greater permissions as explained in the [toAdminUser method](#toadminuser) below.

We use [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) to handle authentication. For every call that needs authentication (user with a `StandardUser` role or an `Admin` role), you will need to pass the JWT in the headers under the value `OPENLAW_JWT`.

The class APIClient handles setting the token in the headers automatically for convenience. Subsequent method calls on the APIClient class instance after login will already have the JWT set. However, you will need to handle passing the JWT in the headers if you implement the REST calls without the APIClient wrapper.

### login

```
POST /app/login
```

**Parameters**

| Name       | Type     | Description                               |

:::

**Response**
