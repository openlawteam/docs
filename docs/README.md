## Overview of OpenLaw

### Contracts Are Changing

It is now possible to model all or parts of legal agreements using code (smart contracts), decreasing the cost and friction of creating, securing, and generating binding legal agreements.

### No Comprehensive Tool

Lawyers lack basic tools to build these dynamic, “smart” contracts in a way that is enforceable and understandable to a legal professional.

### OpenLaw Protocol

OpenLaw is building a technology stack to help power next generation "smart" legal agreements. The OpenLaw protocol documentation is intended to provide a resource for developers to build around our open source language and integration APIs.
