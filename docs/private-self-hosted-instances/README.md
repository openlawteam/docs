# Private and Self-Hosted Instances

## Private Instances

If you're interested in having your own copy of OpenLaw, complete with private database for your templates, users, contracts, and other data, you can request what we call a private instance. This instance is guaranteed to always be running the latest version of the OpenLaw application (released weekly). You can submit a request for a private instance [here](https://openlaw.io/private-instances) and a member of our team will reach out to you to discuss your requirements.

## Self-Hosted Instances

You can also self-host a copy of OpenLaw. Currently, the main option for doing so is via our partner [Kaleido](https://kaleido.io). You can find information regarding how to set up an OpenLaw instance on Kaleido, including a walkthrough video, on the [Kaleido-OpenLaw Integration Page](https://marketplace.kaleido.io/partner/openlaw).
