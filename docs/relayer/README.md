# Relayer

## Overview and How It Works

This section describes how OpenLaw execute and schedule recurring smart contract calls.

## Challenges

Many commercial relationships involve ongoing transfers of assets between parties.  Blockchains are not capable of executing and scheduling the transfer of assets between parties.  OpenLaw has built in tooling that makes it possible to create recurring smart contract calls to model out and execute more complex commercial relationships.
