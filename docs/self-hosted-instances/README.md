# Self-Hosted Instances

If you're interested in having your own OpenLaw instance, you can self-host a copy of OpenLaw. Currently, the main option for doing so is via our partner [Kaleido](https://kaleido.io). You can find information regarding how to set up an OpenLaw instance on Kaleido, including a walkthrough video, on the [Kaleido-OpenLaw Integration Page](https://marketplace.kaleido.io/partner/openlaw).
