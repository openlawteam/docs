## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[OpenLaw Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are
expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to
[opensource@openlaw.io](mailto:opensource@openlaw.io).

## Questions

> **Note:** If you have a question, please don't file an issue. You'll
> get faster results by using the resource below.

We have a detailed FAQ on our website.

- [OpenLaw FAQ](https://openlaw.io/faq)

We also have an active OpenLaw Community Slack:

- [Join the Openlaw Community Slack
  Team](https://join.slack.com/t/openlaw-community/shared_invite/enQtMzY1MTA2ODY3ODg5LTg5NjA2ZjAzMjY3YzI0NTU2NmU3ZmU5ZGQ0NjE3YjdkNjRjZGJlNjFjNjg1NzZiM2Q3YjZhNGEzYzEwYTBiMjU)
  - Even though Slack is a chat service, sometimes it takes several
    hours for OpenLaw team members to respond &mdash; however, we'll get to
    your query as soon as we can! Our team is distributed across timezones
    and wants to help you.
  - Use the `#general` channel for general questions or discussion
    about OpenLaw.
  - Use the `#bugs` channel for reporting bugs with the OpenLaw
    application (as distinct from bugs you encounter in running one of our
    core libraries &mdash; for those, you should open an issue as discussed
    [below](#reporting-bugs).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for OpenLaw
Docs. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related
reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this
list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you
don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please
[include as many details as
possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the
> same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link
> to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Reach out to our team on Slack in the `#bugs` channel.**
- **Perform a [cursory
  search](https://github.com/openlawteam/docs/issues)**
  to see if the problem has already
  been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment
  to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub
issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

When creating an issue, explain the problem and include additional
details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
  problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many
  details as possible. For example, start by explaining what you are
  trying to do with OpenLaw Docs. When listing steps, **don't just say
  what you did, but explain how you did it**.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links
  to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use
  in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use
  [Markdown code
  blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and
  point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and videos** which show you following the
  described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. We recommend
  [Loom](useloom.com).
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe
  what you were doing before the problem happened and share more
  information using the guidelines below.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
OpenLaw Docs, including completely new features and minor improvements
to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers
and the community understand your suggestion and find related
suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this
list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find
out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an
enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as
possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

- **Perform a [cursory
  search](https://github.com/openlawteam/docs/issues)**
  to see if the enhancement has
  already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue
  instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub
issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Provide the
following information in your issue:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
  suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in
  as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include
  copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown

- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you
  expected to see instead** and why.
